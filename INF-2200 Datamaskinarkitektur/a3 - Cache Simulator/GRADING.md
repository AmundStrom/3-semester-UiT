Hei!

Report:

Nice report, please remember to check the report before handing in, there are some funky renderings in the design and implementation section.

Code:

Very nice implementation, very good use of function pointers.

I think the parameters struct is redundant and could be incorporated into the cache, as it would not make sense alone.
I would also move the implementations of `parameter`, `block` and `cache` into the common.c file
Rename `common.c` and `common.h` to something more describing.

GRADE: PASS

Good luck with the exam!
