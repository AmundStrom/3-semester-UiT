Hei!

Report:

Introduction:

Ok, i would write more about what the simulator implements.

Please write the report using `passive voice` ie. no personal pronouns.
This is not a diary (I did this then that etc.)

Methods:

Nice use of figure!

Good design.

Ok implementation, i would like more on how you have implemented the different components.
It is nice that you have elaborated about odd implementation decitions though.

Good experiments section.

Discussion:

Good!

Conclusion:

Good.

Code:

The code looks funtional, i would like more unit-tests of each component.
This is becuase it will be easier for you and me to check that the component (and whole implmentation) works as intended, and if there are any mistakes it would be easier to spot.

The single cycle implementation looks like it works.

GRADE: PASS
